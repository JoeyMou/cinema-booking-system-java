# cinema-booking-system-java
This is my first J2EE project. I achieved it when I was a junior.

It is a J2EE project but also very basic. I achieved the most typical *MVC* model utilizing *Servlet*, *JSP* and *JavaBean*.

Now, two years later, I'm going to use some other techniques to achieve this J2EE project the other way. So, I set this branch 1.0. If you want to see the current version, please switch the branch.

Thank you:)
